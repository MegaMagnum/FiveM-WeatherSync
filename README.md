# FiveM-WeatherSync
This script allows the weather in a FiveM server to be hosted by the server. This is done with Globalstates en stagebag handlers. 

If you want to allow admins to adjust time in-game use the ACE: *'Weathersync.change'*

- /Freezeweather (This freezes the dynamic weather of the script)
- /Freezetime (This freezes the change of time)
- /Time (This allows you to change the time ingame)
- /Weather (This allows you to change the weather ingame)
- /Blackout (Turns off all lights in the game)
